Drawing bot design

Based on DrawingBot on Thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1517211
Re-use bunch of SCAD utility objects from Mendel90.

Re-worked to provide source in openscad.
Change Y pitch to allow more room for idlers.
Change idler mounts to act as belt guides to avoid belt coming off idlers.
